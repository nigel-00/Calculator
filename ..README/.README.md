# Overview

I wrote a simple calculator in Java that uses the rhino,a third party JavaScript library. The rhino library essentially help with the
mathematical calculations. The calculator takes multiple numbers and with the use of brackets to separate different operators for 
correct answers. The calculator has the ability to perform and calculate power of a number. The calculator has a clear button that
allows you clear the screen view and refresh to perform new calculations

i wrote this app because I wanted to test my knowledge and create my own calculator from scratch. I wanted to demonstrate my 
Java knowledge and use learn to use 3rd party libraries and integrate them to my project.
